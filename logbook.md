	Meeting with supervisor to try and figure out what is possible. Decided to pivot on the method to scale JCI. Look into FCI

- ### May 4th, 2017
	Looked at ACI code with supervisor, with FCI approach this code can be adjusted to scale JCI. Decide to look at JCI-FCI instead of JCI-ACID.

- ### May 7th, 2017
	Try to get some of the methods working for ACI code, adjusted some parameters as discussed with my supervisor. Ran into some trouble, possibly bugs?

- ### May 8th, 2017
	Meeting with supervisor to go through code, find some bugs. Forked ACI repo and added some fixes to repo.

- ### May 9th, 2017
	Read paper about FCI and worked on literature review

- ### May 11th, 2017
	Worked on code for pcalg-fci to figure out how it works and what all the parameters mean

- ### May 15th, 2017
	Did academic english course, figured out pcalg parameters. Tested parameters but those did not do what I expected them to do.

- ### May 16th, 2017
	Meeting with supervisor, decided approach for FCI plan. Need to figure out whether to use FCI or GFCI.

- ### May 17th, 2017
	Read GFCI paper

- ### May 18th, 2017
	Tried to figure out rcausal package. Prior knowledge from file not working yet. Runs without prior knowledge though.

- ### May 19th, 2017
 	Worked on literature review and read up more on rcausal package.

- ### May 20th, 2017
	Finished literature review and e-mailed to supervisor.

- ### May 21st, 2017
	Got feedback from supervisor on literature review, processed feedback and handed in literature review.

- ### May 22nd, 2017
	Tried running GFCI-JCI with rcausal package, prior knowledge from file still not working but it can be added from the code.

- ### May 23rd, 2017
	Meeting with supervisor, since GFCI-JCI is now working and its results make sense next step can be taken. Understand JCI more, and maybe implement GFCI-JCI into causam package. Also start formulating knowledge in thesis.

- ### May 24th, 2017
	Read extra JCI papers and paper about sachs data

- ### May 25th, 2017
	Worked on mid-term presentation, used previous presentation as template

- ### May 26th, 2017
	Made outline to discuss preliminary knowledge to understand thesis in thesis

- ### May 30th, 2017
	Worked on mid-term presentation, looked at displaying scores on the edges in graphs in results for fges. No success so far.

- ### May 31st, 2017
	Meeting with supervisor. Finished presentation. Tried to figure out how to display graphs of GFCI results.

- ### June 1st, 2017
	Did Midterm presentation

- ### June 2nd, 2017
	Cleaned code a little to make it more

- ### June 5th, 2017
	Rewrote a few sections of thesis, and improved writing

- ### June 6th, 2017
	Meeting with supervisor, decided to use simulation data and precision recall curves

- ### June 7th, 2017
	Adjusted previously handed in assignments to fit together more nicely in thesis

- ### June 8th, 2017
	Wrote JCI part for thesis

- ### June 10th, 2017
	Got code to simulate data working

- ### June 12th, 2017
	Found out code not working completely as expected, trying to fix it

- ### June 13th, 2017
	Went to Science Park for feedback session, wasn't where i was supposed to be apparently

- ### June 14th, 2017
	Worked on thesis wrote method and approach

	Wrote explanation on non-deterministic JCI and other sections of thesis

- ### June 16th, 2017
	Organized basic graph knowledge in thesis and added some clarifying illustrations to illustrate theoretical concepts

- ### June 19th, 2017
	Reread writing so far for thesis and removed grammar/spelling errors and rewrote a few sections for clarity. Added GFCI section to explain the algorithm more clearly.

- ### June 20th, 2017
	Had a meeting with my supervisor, need to explain the concepts used for thesis more clearly. Looked over code and started work on rewriting some code to accurately evaluate results.

- ### June 21st, 2017
	Put my code into functions for easier loading with aci package and more modular structure.

- ### June 22nd, 2017
	Finished bootstrapping gfci and integrating roc curves into code, also fixed bugs. Started work on presentation.

- ### June 23rd, 2017
	Meeting with supervisor. Started on presentation, processed some of the feedback for thesis. Added intervention variables to evaluation of algorithm and fixed some bugs. Results look more decent now

- ### June 24th, 2017
	Finished writing method & approach and started integrating results into thesis. Ran simulations but ran into some errors for FGES. Added intervention variables to true graph as well.

- ### June 25th, 2017
	Removed some bugs from code and added separate average precision and recall to methods. Added method to combine ROC curves for more polished graphs.

- ### June 26th, 2017
	Worked on presentation, finished writing most of it. Started running experiments again to implement into presentation.

- ### June 27th, 2017
	Fixed some bugs and generated final. results. Finished presentation, and received feedback. Fixed bootstrap bugs and started work on real-world dataset section of thesis as well as fixing layout issues.

- ### June 28th, 2017
	Real-world dataset results graph generated and compared to ACI results. Handed in finished presentation with feedback processed. Made functions to run all experiments at once for each dataset. Improved graphviz function and fixed mistake that was made when loading sachs dataset.

- ### June 29th, 2017
	Generated ancestral graph and compared to ACI results.

- ### June 30th, 2017
	Finished generating results and writing discussion and conclusion. Processed feedback and handed in thesis.
